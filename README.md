Oozaru Web Instance
===================

Once the engine has been built using `tsc`, this directory will contain a
complete compiled copy of the Oozaru game engine, ready for upload along with
a Sphere game to any Web host.

If you're using a recent version of Sphere Studio, you can point the Oozaru
plugin at this directory to test your games in Oozaru locally.
