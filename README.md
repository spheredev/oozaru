currently in beta.

Oozaru is still in early development so there are no downloads yet. Stay tuned!

## About the Project

### The Name 🐒

"Oozaru" is the Japanese name for the Saiyans' Great Ape transformation from
Dragon Ball Z, and follows in a long tradition of Sphere v2-related projects
being named for Dragon Ball concepts, joining the ranks of **Cell**, the Sphere
compiler; and **SSj**, the Sphere debugger.

### Goal ✔

The goal of the Oozaru project is to make a lightweight browser-based game
engine based on established Web and JavaScript technologies wherever possible.
The engine should be fully usable in a reasonably modern browser without the
user having to install external plugins or extensions, and it should be
possible to write JavaScript code which will execute in both Oozaru and
[miniSphere](https://github.com/fatcerberus/miniSphere) without modifications.

### License 📜

Like miniSphere, the engine it's based on, Oozaru is licensed under the terms
of the BSD-3-clause license. The engine can be used for any purpose, even
commercially, with no other requirements except to maintain the accompanying
copyright notice and license text.
