Oozaru Changelog
================

v0.7.0 - December 18, 2024

  the clipping box is changed by the call.

----------------------

* Adds support for the `Color.CosmicLatte` predefined color.

v0.5.0 - January 5, 2022
------------------------

* Adds support for background-loading `Font`, `Shader`, `Sound`, and `Texture`
  assets via `new`, along with APIs to check when a background-loaded asset is

* Adds the ability to click in the rendering area or press a key to start the

  values for `text`.

v0.4.0 - December 18, 2021

  game.
* Adds full support for multiple games via a JSON index in `./games`.
* Removes support for loading games from `./dist`.

------------------------

* Adds support for importing the Sphere Runtime as `/lib/sphere-runtime.js`.

----------------------

* Fixes a bug where `SoundStream` playback produces an annoying buzzing noise.

v0.2.7 - May 28, 2020
---------------------

  drawn at non-integer coordinates.

v0.2.6 - May 24, 2020
---------------------

* Fixes a bug where the Fido progress percentage could jump around erratically
  while fetching multiple files.

v0.2.5 - February 24, 2020
--------------------------

* Renames `FileStream.open()` to `FileStream.fromFile()` for API parity with
  miniSphere.
* Fixes a bug where `from()` doesn't immediately check whether the source(s)
  passed are nullish, leading to more obtuse errors later.

v0.2.4 - February 19, 2020
--------------------------

* Improves performance of `IndexBuffer#upload()` on macOS.

v0.2.3 - February 15, 2020
--------------------------

  haven't changed since it was last active.
* Fixes an issue where rendering performance is suboptimal in all browsers on
  macOS.

v0.2.2 - February 9, 2020
-------------------------

* Adds a `start` label under the Sphere logo before a game is launched to
  indicate where to click to start a game.

v0.2.1 - February 8, 2020
-------------------------

-------------------------

v0.1.1 - January 13, 2020
-------------------------

* Improves readability of crash messages by word-wrapping the exception text.
* Fixes an issue where an uncaught exception thrown while executing Sphere code
  gets caught by the engine and thus may not be intercepted by JS debuggers.

v0.1.0 - January 5, 2020
------------------------

First official Oozaru release.  API parity with miniSphere is passable, but far
from complete. A lot of Sphere v2 code will run as-is, with the caveat that
the browser must support import maps in order to import from `sphere-runtime`.
